# Data Report – VolleyTrack

## Introduction
In the **VolleyTrack** project, data is collected during a volleyball match, such as points, attacks, tips, errors, opponent scoring zones, ball positions, and timing between actions. This data is used to analyze match performance.

Although the data provides useful insights, it also has several limitations that can affect its accuracy.

## Potential Issues and Limitations

### Manual data entry
All statistics are entered manually during the match. This can lead to mistakes such as missed actions, incorrect inputs, or double-counted events. Different users may also interpret actions differently.

### Limited data validation
There are few validation checks on the entered data. As a result, unrealistic or inconsistent data can be recorded.

### Inaccurate timing
The timing between actions is based on when the user clicks, not on the exact moment the action occurs on the court. Therefore, the timing reflects user reaction time rather than actual game speed.

### Lack of context
The data does not include information about sets, rotations, or rallies. Additionally, information about the opponent is limited, which restricts deeper tactical analysis.

### Small and subjective dataset
The data usually comes from a single match and is recorded by one person. This results in a small dataset that may be influenced by personal bias.

## What I Learned
This project showed that data is rarely perfect. The way data is collected has a significant impact on its quality. By acknowledging the limitations, the data can still be used in a meaningful way.

## Conclusion
The data in **VolleyTrack** is not fully accurate or complete, but it provides valuable insights into match performance. Understanding its limitations allows for better interpretation and forms a solid foundation for future improvements.
